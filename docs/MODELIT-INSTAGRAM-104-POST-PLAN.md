### **Q: How do I measure ROI on this effort?**
**A**: Track:
- Website traffic from Instagram (Google Analytics)
- TPT store visits from Instagram (TPT analytics)
- Email sign-ups attributed to Instagram
- Community size (followers who engage regularly)

### **Q: What about Instagram Stories, Reels, and other formats?**
